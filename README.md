This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Before running anything, make sure to install the depencies for the front-end and backend.

First, run the rest_api server built with django:

```bash
python manage.py runserver

```


Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## File Structure

There are two root folders for the whole project. One for the front-end (built with Next.Js) and one for the back-end (built with Django Rest Api)
